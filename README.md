‚õìÔ∏è Trapchain: LLM-Powered Honeypot Monitoring on Azure Kubernetes
Trapchain is an experimental honeypot and observability project that deploys containerized deception environments (Cowrie & Dionaea) to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, with real-time monitoring and LLM-based log analysis. The goal is to explore how large language models can assist in identifying suspicious behavior from noisy log data generated by exposed network services.

### üóÇÔ∏è This project combines:

1) Terraform IaC to provision the AKS cluster, virtual network, subnet, and security groups on Azure

2) Helm + Kubernetes manifests to deploy and expose Cowrie and Dionaea honeypots within a separate honeypots namespace

3) Prometheus with custom extraScrapeConfigs for fine-grained metrics collection on honeypot pods

4) LLM agents (in development) to continuously parse logs, flag anomalies, and suggest likely attack patterns or TTPs

üõ†Ô∏è Think of it as a fusion of cloud-native security experimentation, AI-driven observability, and hands-on threat modeling.

### üîç Why Build This?

To explore the practical applications of LLMs in real-time threat detection.

To study how attackers behave against commonly exploited ports and protocols.

To learn and iterate quickly using reproducible, infrastructure-as-code deployments.
